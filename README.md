## 👋 Hi there!



 
I started with a Data Analytics certificate at RMIT. There, I learned tools like SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, and even put them to work at Alfred Health, crafting dashboards that brought data to life. But I'm not stopping there! To dive deeper into the technical side, I'm now enrolled in Monash's Bootcamp, tackling data science and machine learning. Every day brings new challenges and exciting discoveries, and I'm loving the continuous learning. I'm constantly striving to improve, and I can't wait to see where this data adventure takes me!



**- 🌱 I’m currently learning:** More about Python, Machine learning and HTML/CSS

**- 📫 How to reach me:** hesampour.mahsa@gmail.com

**- ✈️ More about me:** With a passport full of stamps and a camera by my side, I'm always on the lookout for new adventures. 
                   Exploring different cultures has broadened my perspective, just like photography helps me capture the 
                   intricate details of the world around me. Both remind me that a closer look often reveals hidden beauty 
                  and unexpected connections.
